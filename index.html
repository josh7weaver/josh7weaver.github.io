          <p>Gary Alberts needed to sell his truck covers online. Armed with one web design class, I decided that Ecommerce shouldn't be a big deal. I was wrong. Although I had learned the basics of HTML/CSS in my web design course, the shopping cart solution I decided to implement for the site was written in PHP, and the learning curve was sharp, but I managed to get everything working, from tweaking the theme to registering SSL certs. whew!</p>

              <p>The White Rose Gallery is the internet home of a portfolio/informational site for Sandy and Becky, artists in Charlotte. They needed an inexpensive presence on the web that they could update. So, I modified a flash template to suit her needs. Since she needed to be able to update the page herself, I used actionscript to pull in the content from a file, which allows her to update the flash template by simply editing a text file. The design is horid, but the code works!<br />

              <p>
                 Around this time I started getting into Wordpress. Its free and there's a great community! However, I didn't yet realize what a pain it is to template inside.
                 I handled all the front end development on the sites as well as setting up the server and DB. I was doing a lot of hacking in PHP for these sites.
                 The church websites involved:
                 <ul>
                  <li>Creating a page to display calander information from Google Cal</li>
                  <li>Setting up custom content types</li>
                  <li>Creating a custom loop and template for the homepage</li>
                  <li>Custom code to create a sermon archive page with links to audio files and video (if they existed)</li>
                  <li>Some fancy frills in JQuery</li>
                 </ul>
                 
                 <br />
                 I built 3 websites on Wordpress. One each for Freedom Fellowship Church, Kingsway Church, and for a startup of mine called College Stuff Swap.

                 <ul>
                  <li>Interfacing between devs at TechMuscle, the developer at the Flash development company, Tresemme brand reps, and Giant Squid (a marketing/design agency)</li>

Part of the fun of this work was:
                 <ul>
                  <li>Making sure ALL assets for the Mercedes-Benz Fashion week were properly processed and added to the website. We had to turn the assets around same day. There were 3 fashion shows I managed.</li>
                  <li>Managing a production team.</li>
                  <li>Learning to use Photoshop and Illustrator</li>

              <p>
                 As TechMuscle transitioned from a service company to a product company, I got to try my hand at design. At first I was intimidated because I don't do well with colors, but then I realized that design as problem solving - I can do that! The primary app I worked on UI for was an outlook plugin to improve email. This involved interfacing with C# methods and using jQuery to manipulate the html views. We used a combination of Kanban in JIRA and a Agile SCRUM process for development.

                 After working with wordpress for several years I got tired of writing REALLY complicated "if" statements and query modifiers to the loop to create custom pages, and discovered Expression Engine. I used Expression Engine for the <a href="http://www.iwusga.com/" target="_blank">new SGA website</a> (Student Government Association) at Indiana Wesleyan University. Working with designers and a developer in the UK I got to see how an EE site is set up, and got to work with global variables as well as the templating code they provide. A breath of fresh air after wordpress!
